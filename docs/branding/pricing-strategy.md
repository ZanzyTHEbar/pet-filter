# Pricing Strategy: PetFilter

## 1. Price Positioning

### 1.1 Market Context

| Category | Price Range | PetFilter Position |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Sprays/Powders | $5-15 | Far above (different category) |
| Carbon bags/gels | $10-30 | Far above (different category) |
| HEPA air purifiers (pet) | $80-300 | Above (better technology) |
| Smart litter boxes | $400-700 | Below (complementary, not competitive) |
| **PetFilter** | **$349-449** | **Premium efficacy, mid-range device** |

### 1.2 Value Justification
- Annual cost of sprays/powders that don't work: $60-180/year
- PetFilter pays for itself vs. spray habit within 2-3 years
- PetFilter actually removes ammonia (sprays don't) -- priceless for serious cat owners
- Cheaper than smart litter boxes that don't address air quality

## 3. Pricing Psychology

### 3.1 Anchoring
- Always show the smart litter box price ($500-700) as comparison
- "Less than a Litter-Robot, and it actually cleans your air"
- Show annual spray cost ($120-180/yr) to demonstrate payback

### 3.2 Price Ending
- Device: $399 (not $399.99 -- premium products use round-ish numbers)
- Filters: $9.99/month (subscription convention)
- Avoid $X.97 pricing (signals discount/value brand)

### 3.3 Decoy Effect
- Always show 3 options: Device alone ($399), Device + 6mo filters ($429), Device + 12mo filters ($449)
- The $449 annual plan should look like the best value (and it is)
