### 1.2 Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

Smart/electronic pet odor devices represent the SAM. This includes:
- Electronic air purifiers marketed to pet owners
- Smart litter boxes with odor control features
- UV-based sanitization devices

**Estimated SAM**: $500M-1B (subset of pet odor control where consumers pay $100+ for a device)

### 1.3 Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

PetFilter targets the premium niche: tech-savvy cat owners willing to pay $300-450 for a device that demonstrably eliminates odor (not just masks it).

**Estimated SOM**: $10-50M in initial target segment
- Assumes 0.5-2% penetration of the premium device segment
- 30,000-100,000 units at $349-449 retail

### 1.4 US Cat Ownership Statistics

- 46.5 million US households own cats (2023-2024, APPA)

## 2. Market Drivers

### 2.1 Pet Humanization ("Pet Parent" Culture)
The shift from pet "owner" to pet "parent" drives premium spending. Pet parents invest in quality-of-life products for both themselves and their animals. The average US household spent $1,533 on pets in 2023 (APPA), with spending on non-essential/premium products growing fastest.

### 2.2 Urban Living + Small Spaces
Urban professionals in apartments face concentrated odor problems. No backyard, limited ventilation, smaller square footage = odor is impossible to ignore. This demographic overlaps heavily with the tech-savvy, premium-buying segment.

### 2.3 Indoor Air Quality Awareness (Post-COVID)
Consumer awareness of indoor air quality has permanently shifted. HEPA filters, air purifiers, and air quality monitors saw 300%+ demand growth 2020-2022 and have maintained elevated baselines. Pet owners increasingly connect pet odor to air quality health concerns.

### 2.4 Premiumization
Consumers are trading up from cheap sprays ($5-15) to devices ($100-700). The Litter-Robot 4 at $699 sells well, proving willingness to pay for effective solutions. PetFilter sits in a sweet spot: more effective than cheap products, less expensive than premium smart litter boxes.

### 2.5 Subscription Economy
Recurring revenue models (filter replacements, water treatment supplies) align with consumer expectations. Pet product subscriptions grew 25%+ annually through 2024.
