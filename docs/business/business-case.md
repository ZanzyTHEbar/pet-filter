# Business Case: PetFilter

## 1. Executive Summary

PetFilter is a compact venturi-based water scrubber that eliminates pet odors -- primarily ammonia from cat litter -- by exploiting a fundamental chemistry gap no consumer competitor addresses: ammonia's extreme water solubility. The device retails at $349-449 with 57%+ gross margins and generates recurring filter subscription revenue at 65%+ margins. With a $1.7B pet odor control market growing at 8.5% CAGR and zero direct competitors using this approach, the opportunity is both substantial and defensible.

## 2. Problem Statement

Cat litter odor is the #1 complaint among cat owners. 46.5 million US households own cats. 70% cite odor as their primary litter concern. The current market offers:
- Sprays and powders that mask odor (zero ammonia removal)
- HEPA/carbon purifiers that capture 20-40% of ammonia at best
- Smart litter boxes ($400-700) that handle waste but ignore the air
- Ozone generators that work but are unsafe for continuous use

None attack the root cause: airborne ammonia.

## 3. Solution

PetFilter passes contaminated air through a venturi nozzle where it contacts water. Ammonia (Henry's constant 0.00075) dissolves into the water at 80-95% efficiency per pass. UVC light degrades dissolved compounds. Carbon + HEPA filtration handles particulates and residual VOCs.

**Key differentiator**: Water scrubbing achieves 4-5x better ammonia removal than activated carbon alone. This is physics, not marketing.

## 5. Financial Projections

### 5-Year Revenue Model

| Year | Device Units | Device Revenue | Filter Revenue | Total Revenue |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Y1 | 750 | $262K | $27K | $289K |
| Y2 | 3,000 | $1.05M | $162K | $1.21M |
| Y3 | 8,000 | $2.80M | $594K | $3.39M |
| Y4 | 20,000 | $7.00M | $1.78M | $8.78M |
| Y5 | 40,000 | $14.0M | $3.96M | $17.96M |

### Profitability Path

| Year | Revenue | Gross Profit | Operating Expenses | Net Profit |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Y1 | $289K | $165K | $120K | $45K |
| Y2 | $1.21M | $691K | $350K | $341K |
| Y3 | $3.39M | $1.94M | $850K | $1.09M |
| Y4 | $8.78M | $5.01M | $2.00M | $3.01M |
| Y5 | $17.96M | $10.26M | $4.00M | $6.26M |

**Key assumption**: Operating expenses include marketing (30-40% of revenue in Y1-2, declining to 20-25% as organic grows), plus R&D, G&A, and fulfillment overhead.

## 6. Competitive Moats

1. **Physics moat**: Ammonia's water solubility is a fundamental constant. Carbon filtration cannot match it.
2. **Patent moat**: Utility patent on venturi-based air scrubbing for pet/residential odor control.
3. **Brand moat**: First mover in "science-based pet air treatment" category.
4. **Data moat**: Air quality data from deployed devices informs product improvement.
5. **Switching costs**: Filter subscription + accumulated air quality history.

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Efficacy below 80% in real conditions | Critical | Low | Extensive POC testing before launch commitment |
| Large competitor (Dyson, Litter-Robot) copies | High | Medium | Patent, speed to market, brand establishment |
| Solo founder execution risk | High | Medium | Phased approach, outsource manufacturing |
| Price resistance at $349+ | Medium | Medium | Demonstrate ROI vs. recurring spray costs ($60-180/yr) |
| UVC regulatory complexity | Medium | Low | Full enclosure design, UL certification from day one |
| Supply chain disruption | Medium | Medium | Dual-source critical components, maintain safety stock |

## 8. Investment Requirements

### Self-Funded Path (Solo Founder)

| Phase | Timeline | Capital Required | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| POC | Months 0-3 | $1,500 | $1,500 |
| Engineering prototype | Months 3-6 | $6,000 | $7,500 |
| Pre-production (50 units) | Months 6-10 | $25,000 | $32,500 |
| Kickstarter + first 500 units | Months 10-14 | $75,000 | $107,500 |

**Kickstarter target**: $50,000 (covers first production run tooling + inventory)

### Alternative: Raise Pre-Seed
- Amount: $150K-250K
- Use: Accelerate timeline, professional certifications, initial inventory
- Offer: 10-15% equity, SAFE note
- When: After successful POC demonstrates >80% ammonia removal

## 9. Decision Criteria

**Proceed with full development if POC demonstrates**:
1. >80% ammonia reduction in controlled test
2. Noise <50 dB(A) at 1m (with mitigation measures)
3. No unexpected safety issues
4. BOM validates at <$250 per unit (prototype scale)

**Kill criteria**:
- <60% ammonia reduction (physics doesn't work at this scale)
- Unavoidable noise >60 dB(A) (not acceptable for residential)
- UVC safety cannot be guaranteed with enclosure design
